CHARMM36 all-atom lipid force field (with CHARMM22 plus CMAP protein force field and CHARMM27 nucleic acid force field)

This is the GROMACS 4.5.7 version of this force field (see http://www.gromacs.org/About_Gromacs/Release_Notes/Versions_4.5.x for any force field difference to the 4.5.4 version).

Most of this forcefield is taken from the CHARMM27 port so please look at the forcefield.doc from the charmm27.ff folder for references, but make sure you cite:

Bjelkmar, P., Larsson, P., Cuendet, M. A, Bess, B., Lindahl, E.
Implementation of the CHARMM force field in GROMACS: Analysis of protein
stability effects from correction maps, virtual interaction sites, and
water models., Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 6: 459-466, 2010.


The lipid parameters were converted from the CHARMM36 .rtf, .par and .str files (by Thomas Piggot, as well as Par Bjelkmar for lipid.rtp), so also cite the CHARMM36 paper:

Jeffery B. Klauda, Richard M. Venable, J. Alfredo Freites, Joseph

the CHARMM All-Atom Additive Force Field for Lipids: Validation on Six
Lipid Types" J. Phys. Chem. B, 2010, 114 (23), pp 7830–7843


Finally we also ask you to please read and cite our work, validating this conversion. We hope that you also find this work useful as a guide for the selection of appropriate parameters to use with this lipid force field in GROMACS:
